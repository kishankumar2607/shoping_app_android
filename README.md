# Firebase Group App

## Overview

The Firebase Group App is an Android application designed to provide users with an order confirmation screen, showcasing their order details and allowing them to continue shopping or view their order details. It includes integration with Firebase for handling user authentication and backend operations (if applicable). This project is primarily focused on the order confirmation functionality and the user interface layout for a seamless order experience.

## Features

- **Order Confirmation Screen**: The user is presented with an order confirmation screen after placing an order. This includes a confirmation message, the order number, delivery date, and total order cost.
  
- **Continue Shopping Button**: Redirects the user back to the product page to continue shopping. 
  
- **View Order Details Button**: A placeholder feature, for now, displays a toast message, signaling that the order details page is under development.
  
- **Dynamic Delivery Date**: The app calculates the delivery date by adding one day to the current date and formats it in a user-friendly manner.

## App Structure

### `OrderConfirmationActivity` 

The `OrderConfirmationActivity` serves as the screen where the user can see the confirmation details of their order. It utilizes **view binding** to manage UI components. Below is a breakdown of key elements:

1. **Confirmation Icon (`ImageView`)**: Displays an image indicating that the order has been confirmed (e.g., a checkmark or success icon).

2. **Order Confirmation Title (`TextView`)**: A bold text element that greets the user with "Thank You!" or a similar message.

3. **Order Confirmation Message (`TextView`)**: A text element informing the user that their order has been successfully placed.

4. **Order Details Card (`CardView`)**:
    - **Order Number**: Displays the unique order number.
    - **Order Date**: Displays the dynamic delivery date, generated by adding one day to the current date.
    - **Order Total**: Displays the total cost of the order, passed via an `Intent` from a previous screen.

5. **Continue Shopping Button**: This button, when clicked, redirects the user back to the product page (`ProductActivity`).

6. **View Order Details Button**: Currently displays a toast message that the order details page is under development.

### `getDeliveryDate()` Method

This method calculates the delivery date by adding one day to the current date. It uses the `Calendar` and `SimpleDateFormat` classes to generate the formatted date.

```kotlin
private fun getDeliveryDate(): String {
    val calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
    calendar.add(Calendar.DATE, 1)
    val dateFormat = SimpleDateFormat("dd MMMM yyyy", Locale.getDefault())
    return dateFormat.format(calendar.time)
}
